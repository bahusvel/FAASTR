The kernel began life from redox tag version 0.3.5, it should be included in this repo, but if ever it is lost its important.

Notes on reverse engineering redox's code:

* arch/x86_64/pti is a page table isolation feature (unmaps kernel pages) to help against meltdown attack. This is not essential and it seems to only do stuff with stack and otherwise seems useless.

* BSP is the first processor and APs are secondary/auxilary processors.
