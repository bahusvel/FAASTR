The system calls are essential operations available to functions, the include function call, return and memory management.

The ABI x86_64 ABI is:
syscall_number = rax
sos_pointer = rbx
sos_length = rcx
On the return from the system call the kernel will leave rax alone, and set rbx and rcx respectively pointing to return values.
